🌟 Zendalona: Making Tech Friendly for the Visually Impaired 👁️‍🗨️💻
Zendalona is a cool tech project focused on helping people who are visually impaired. It was started by K. Sathyaeselan, who lost his vision due to an accident. He realized how hard it is for blind people to read or get access to knowledge because many tools just don’t support them.

He created Zendalona to fix this. It's an open-source project, which means anyone can use, change, and improve the software for free! 🎉
